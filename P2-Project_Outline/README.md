Overview:
	Our app will be a recipe creating and sharing (or recipe book) app. It will allow users to create an account and use that account to post new recipes, save favorites, and comment/provide feedback on tried recipes. Users will also be able to follow their favorite creators to stay up-to-date with any new posts. For new recipes, some general starter templates will be available(i.e. a cookie template would include eggs, butter, flour, and baking soda).
Features: 
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for recipe posts containing given text.
Create Post: Users will be able to create new recipe posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.
View Recipe: Users will be able to view recipes from other users.
Create Tags For A Recipe: Users will be able to apply tags to my recipes so that others can find my recipes more easily.
Edit/Delete Recipe: Users will be able to edit and delete a recipe they posted.
Recipe Template: Users will be able to create a recipe using a template.
